methods_long: "The fractional order generalized SEIR model considers the power law functions of infection cases, as well as the recovery and death.\  
    \ It is necessary to introduce the fractional integral with long memory property based on the integer  order SEIR model. Through the\
    \ time-weighted performance index (ITSE) of the model fitting and parameter sensitivity analysis  of the model using Simulink Design Optimization (SLDO),\
    \ it is proved that the fractional order model is superior to the integer order model in terms of short-term prediction. In our model, the more accurate\
    \ prediction errors of incident death and cumulative death are provided.\
    \ Based on this model, we can also study the optimization control problem. By studying mobility data, the lock-down\
    \ and release policies of different countries, states and counties are changed accordingly. Control infection rates to\ 
    \ reduce cumulative infections and deaths effectively. The model can not only fit the prediction of infection cases, but\
    \ also achieve a balance between the scale of infection and the socioeconomic status by developing age-based re-open\
    \ intervention through the study of social mobility."
