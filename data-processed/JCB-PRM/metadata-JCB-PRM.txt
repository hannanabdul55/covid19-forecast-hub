methods_long: The Political Realities Model (PRM) is built on observation of macro-level
  societal and political responses to COVID measured only in terms of infections and
  deaths. The starting point of the model is the belief that individuals' and policy
  makers' perceptions of COVID-19 risks generate a relatively narrow and fairly predictable,
  if not ideal, set of responses. Although specific individual behavior and government
  regulation may vary over time and from place to place, the range of what a society
  and its elected officials will accept can relatively easily be characterized. This
  model seeks to characterize these responses and models their impact on infection
  rates, which in turn is related to deaths via a simple (time- and geographically-varying)
  phenomenological model derived through fitting, which therefore builds in variation
  in the demographics of the infected population, access to health care & COVID testing
  and the infection fatality rate from place to place. At present the model is deterministic
  rather than probabilistic, and so only provides point forecasts. The model considers
  the United States at the state level.
