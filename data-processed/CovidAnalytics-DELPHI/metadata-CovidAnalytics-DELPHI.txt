methods: 'This model predicts based on an SEIR model augmented with underdetection
  and interventions. Projections account for reopening and assume interventions would
  be re-enacted if cases continue to climb. '

methods_long: 'This model makes predictions for future cases based on a heavily modified
  SEIR model. New states are added to the SEIR model to account for cases that went
  undetected, and an explicit death state is included. The infection rate is corrected
  with a nonlinear curve that represents the governmental and societal response (which
  is assumed to change according to the magnitude of the outbreak). Key parameters
  for the disease are fixed using a metanalysis  conducted by the CovidAnalytics group
  of over 150 parameters while epidemiological parameters are fitted to hisotical
  death counts and detected cases. '
