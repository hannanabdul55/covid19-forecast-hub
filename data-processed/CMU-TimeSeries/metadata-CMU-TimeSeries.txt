methods_long: "A basic AR-type time series model fit using lagged values of case counts and\
  \ deaths as features. No assumptions are made regarding reopening or governmental\
  \ interventions. The model is jointly fit across all 50 US states, after some time-alignment\
  \ is performed as a preprocessing step to facilitate comparison between states. Heavier\
  \ weight is placed on more recent training data, to account for nonstationarity in the\
  \ underlying process. A lasso penalty is added to induce variable selection and prevent\
  \ overfitting. Quantiles are computed using a residual (Gaussian) bootstrap, separately for\
  \ each location."
