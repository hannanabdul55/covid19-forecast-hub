Our compartmental models are based on a discrete form of nonlinear differential equations, parameterized with dynamic functions (i.e. time-dependent transition rates) that incorporate: (1) the modeled effects of physical distancing and government actions; (2) evolving testing practices in terms of timeliness and scale; (3) the link to tracking and contact tracing, and (4) other region-specific characteristics. Our formulation draws on core methods from both epidemiology and physics. It is data-driven to characterize non-linear transition rates and posits underlying causal mechanisms that we have verified against mobility indices representing physical distancing in mass scale and government response actions.  Our models recalibrate daily with the arrival of new information on COVID-19.  By design, the calibration of our models use region-specific data, as the differences in the timing and execution of government restrictions, testing, population density, social behaviour norms and public responses, re-opening plans, and demographics are extremely relevant. Additional details on our approach, as well as selected forecast results, can be found at: https://pandemicnavigator.oliverwyman.com/\"},\n",

NBDS is a nonparametric Bayesian hierarchical model built on the graph gamma process (GGP). Generated from the GGP is an infinite dimensional directed sparse random graph, which is constructed by taking the OR operation of countably infinite binary adjacency matrices that share the same set of countably infinite nodes. Each of these adjacency matrices is associated with a weight to indicate its overall activation strength, and places a finite number of edges between a finite subset of nodes belonging to the same community. We use the generated random graph, whose number of nonzero-degree nodes is finite, to define both the sparsity patterns and dimensions of the latent state transition matrices of generalized linear dynamical systems. We show how the formed overlapping communities in the latent space can provide interpretable latent transition patterns of the COVID-19 time series, providing good predictive performance and uncertainty estimation.'},\n",

In our model, the more accurate prediction errors of incident death and cumulative death are provided. Based on this model, we can also study the optimization control problem. By studying mobility data, the lock-down and release policies of different countries, states and counties are changed accordingly.

Without any social- distancing policy or geological/demographic inputs, the model works very well  for the twenty hardest-hit counties in the United States. This model is quite  different from other models yet provide parameters with clear physical meaning.  We have shown the cumulative mobility plays the role of time in controling  exponential growth of outbreak. Furthermore, there exists a critical relative  mobility above which outbreak will occur. For NYC, this critical relative  mobility is 30%. The critical relative mobility is ~60% for all other counties.  In this forecast, we chose the 31 heaviest hit states, while combine the rest  of the states together into one superstate. This practice is necessary to obtain  meaningful model parameters. The forecast is based on Eq. 3 of the citation above  in which the reference fatality is a 11-day average centered on 07-28-2020.  The cumulative mobility is the average of three Google mobility categories:  retail and recreation, transit station and work place. We have shown in  our paper those three categorites behave similarly. We conducted standard error  analysis on our forecast in which the uncertainty comes from both the fitting  error and the variation of the reference fatality. Quantile forecast is calculated  based on standard error assuming normal distribution. State-level forecast and  county-level forecast will be conducted later.'},\n",

May 3 - June 7 '80contactw5p': For states maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we apply a 20% weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that reopen, we apply an increase to the contact rate of counties in those states. In the first scenario, we apply a one-time 10% increase to the contact rate during the week that the state is scheduled to reopen and maintain this new increased rate for the remainder of the projection. April 12 - April 26 '70contact': This scenario mimics adaptive adjustments in contact imposed both by government regulations (e.g. school closures, restrictions on mass gatherings) and population self-regulation (e.g. isolation, mask wearing, social distancing).  Upon initiation of projections, all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 30% contact rate reduction. Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 30% contact rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario.

       "   'methods_long': 'The ERDC SEIR model is a process-based model that mathematically describes the virus  dynamics in a population center (e.g., state, CBSA) using assumptions that are common  in compartmental models: (i)   modeled populations are large enough that fluctuations in the disease  states grow slower than averages (i.e., coefficient of variation < 1) (ii)  recovered individuals are neither infectious nor become susceptible to  further infection.\\nThe model is similar to classic SEIR models but with additional compartments for  unreported infections and isolated individuals.  Model parameters describing reporting  rates and transmission rates are allowed to vary in time over over the historical  record as social and policy factors change.  Forecasts into the future, however,  are made under the assumption that the parameters are held constant in time.\\nThe model parameters are estimated from observations of the cumulative number of  cases using a Bayesian approach. Information from subject matter experts (SMEs) is  used to develop a prior probability distribution over the model parameters.  This  then combined with a statistical model of the model-data mismatch to produce a posterior  probability distribution over the model parameters that incorporates both the cumulative  observations and subject matter expertise.  The parameters that maximize the posterior  probability density are used to make forecasts into the future.  The effective reproduction  number is computed using the next-generation matrix method.\\nDeaths are estimated from this model through a procedure which leverages state-level  data on recoveries and fatalities.'},\n",

We modified the model parameters to represent the natural history of COVID-19 and calibrated a set of parameters to reproduce current trends of deaths due to COVID-19 in the US. FRED simulates the spread of the virus in a population by recreating interactions among people on a daily basis. To accurately represent the population of each of the states simulated, we used a synthetic population of the US that represents demographic and geographic characteristics of the population in 2010 (Wheaton 2012). Each human is modeled as an agent that visits a set of places defined by their activity space. This activity space contains places such as households, schools, workplaces, or neighborhood locations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur when an infected person visits the same location as a susceptible person on the same day. Numbers of contacts per person are specific to each place type. For instance, school contacts do not depend on the size of the school but the age of the agent. Infected agents have a probability to stay at home if they develop symptoms. Those who do not stay at home continue their daily activities. Public health interventions are included in the model to represent the changes in agents’ behavior in response to an epidemic.  In this study, we limited the interventions to school closure and shelter in place. Schools are closed on a specific date to represent state-level guidelines (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020). In the case that schools are closed, students limit their activity space to household or neighborhood locations. Shelter-in-place interventions reduce each agent’s activity space to their household at a compliance level from 0-100%, which was estimated as part of the model calibration. Agents who do not comply with the shelter-in-place orders continue with their daily routines. We used state-level orders to determine the date at which people are advised to shelter in place (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020).  See the methods file in our repo for more detailed methods and model limitations.\\nUpdates 2020-05-11 - We updated our likelihood used in our calibration, switching from a Poisson to a negative binomial distribution in order to allow for greater over-dispersion in the distribution of deaths. - We changed the way that we calculate the proportion of the population that is sheltering in place. We no longer use the dates at which government advisories were issued. Instead, we now exclusively use the google mobility data (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on journeys made to residential locations. We calibrate the maximum compliance to shelter in place, and use a generalized additive model fitted to the google data to forecast movement in the coming 5 weeks. For more details on this approach, see the methods file in our repo.'},\n",

Each model compartment is sub-divided into nine different age categories.  To model the state of Illinois, we divide the state into four regions based on the Restore Illinois plan. We infer a common statewide pre-intervention transmission rate, and a separate post-intervention transmission rate for each of the four regions. We also infer a region-specific initial number of infected individuals. Other model parameters are informed by Illinois-specific data or best estimates from existing literature. We fit the model to incident in-hospital deaths and confirmed COVID-19 ICU cases prior to May 15, 2020.   For inference, we use maximum likelihood inference via sequential Monte Carlo for partially observed Markov process models (POMP).   We assume that hospitalized deaths are reported with probability 0.8075 and we fitted the reporting rate of non-hospitalized deaths.  The model can be adapted to investigate different types of interventions.  We currently model shelter-in-place as a reduction in the overall transmission rate, which is shared by all infected individuals, and reductions in age- and location-specific contact rates.\\nTo model the relaxing of shelter-in-place interventions, we project three different scenarios. 1) The inferred post-intervention transmission rate remains unchanged. We assume that this is maximum reduction in transmission and call this model CovidIL_100. 2) The post-SIP transmission rate increases 10% of the way back to pre-SIP transmission according to a logistic function centered on June 1.

The model underlying each is a deterministic, SEIR-like model. Model simulations are initiated by imported infections, which arrive from January 1 onward according to a scaled Normal probability density. Each imported and then local infection gives rise to an average number of secondary infections distributed forward in time according to a generation interval distribution. Once infected, a proportion of those infected die at times distributed according to a distribution between symptom onset and death. Testing of a subset of symptomatic infections is distributed in time in a similar manner, and the model is fitted to data on test positivity by accounting for those seeking testing and a differential probabililty of seeking testing conditional on one's infection status. The model is simultaneously fitted to deaths according to a Poisson likelihood of daily incidence of death. There are a total of twelve model parameters that are all estimated. First, a parameter sweep is conducted to identify the parameter combination from the sweep with the highest likelihood. Then, a region around that parameter combination is assumed to have a uniform prior, and a posterior set of parameters is obtained with MCMC. The model is then simulated forward under each sampled parameter set from the posterior distribution. This process is repeated for each of nine mobility metrics from Apple and Google for 50 states and some territories where at least one type of mobility data is available. Simulations from the posterior predictive distribution of each model are pooled evenly and used to generate a probabilistic forecast in each state and at the national level.\"},\n",

Each model compartment is sub-divided into nine different age categories.  To model the state of Illinois, we divide the state into 3 regions based on similarities in epidemic dynamics. We infer a common statewide pre-intervention transmission rate, and a separate post-intervention transmission rate for each of the three regions. We also infer a region-specific initial number of infected individuals. Other model parameters are informed by Illinois-specific data or best estimates from existing literature. We fit the model to incident in-hospital deaths and confirmed COVID-19 ICU cases prior to May 8, 2020.   For inference, we use maximum likelihood inference via sequential Monte Carlo for partially observed Markov process models (POMP). \\t We assume that hospitalized deaths are reported with probability 0.8075. Because we do not know what might cause underreporting of non-hospitalized deaths, our simulations integrate over that uncertainty by assuming that the reporting rate for non-hospitalized deaths is uniformly distributed from 0.25 to 0.75. The model can be adapted to investigate different types of interventions.  We currently model shelter-in-place as a reduction in the overall transmission rate, which is shared by all infected individuals, and reductions in age- and location-specific contact rates.\\nTo model the relaxing of shelter-in-place interventions, we project four different scenarios. 1) The inferred post-intervention transmission rate remains unchanged. We assume that this is maximum reduction in transmission and call this model CovidIL_100. At our current estimates, this corresponds to a 78% reduction in pre-intervention transmission. 2) Transmission rates increase to 80% of the maximum reduction in transmission according to a logistic function centered on May 29. We call this model CovidIL_80. At our current estimates, this corresopnds to a 74% reduction in pre-intervention transmission. 3) Transmission rates increase to 60% of the maximum reduction in transmission according to a logistic function centered on May 29. We call this model CovidIL_60. At our current estimates, this corresopnds to a 69% reduction in pre-intervention transmission. 4) Transmission rates increase to 40% of the maximum reduction in transmission according to a logistic function centered on May 29. We call this model CovidIL_40. At our current estimates, this corresopnds to a 65% reduction in pre-intervention transmission.'},\n",

Infections are seeded stochastically  with roughly 10 times the number of confirmed cases in the first five days  of a county epidemic and R0 and the duration of the infectious period were  drawn stochastically for each county and simulation. Disease follows SEIR  dynamics and county commuting data modulates the spread of disease within  counties. \\nStay-at-home orders were applied and lifted at the state level according to  recent policy documents. After stay-at-home orders end, social distancing  remains in effect through the end of the simulation with a roughly 25%  reduction in effectiveness relative to that from stay-at-home orders. States  that did not implement stay-at-home orders had a single social distancing  intervention that began on the day of the first reported order and endured  for the whole simulation period. Intervention effects are inferred where  possible.\\nTo model deaths and hospitalizations in the population, we incorporated  realistic time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to  ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to perform  a county-level age standardization of health outcome risk. Currently, we  assume a 0.25% infection fatality rate and a 7:1 ratio of incident  hospitalizations to deaths. \\nFor each county, we estimate the seeding time and amount, the baseline  reproductive number, the case confirmation to infection ratio, and the  effectiveness of interventions (from closing to phased reopenings). We use an  MCMC-like inference procedure that calibrates model outputs to weekly county  aggregations of incident confirmed cases and deaths as reported by USA  Facts. For the inference of the baseline reproductive number and the case  confirmation to infection ratio, hierarchical grouping terms enable sharing  of strength among counties in the same state.\\nOur procedure forecasts incident and cumulative deaths by incorporating the last reported data point (pre-forecast date) from USA Facts.\\nThe estimates reported by this model incorporate uncertainty in both epidemiological parameters (e.g., R0, infectious period, time delays to health outcomes) and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies  on social distancing, stay-at-home orders, and phased reopenings.

Moreover, some of the people in the “Exposed” group can get tested and transferred to the “Infectious” group (which are reported to the public), while the rest of them will recover/die and transit to the so-called “Unreported Recovered” group (which are not reported to the public).

The following week, the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection.

However, in states that reopen, we apply an increase to the contact rates of counties in those states. In the first scenario, we apply a one-time 10% increase to the contact rates during the week that the state is scheduled to reopen and maintain these new increased rates for the remainder of the projection. April 12 - April 26: '80contact' This scenario mimics adaptive adjustments in contact imposed both by government regulations (e.g. school closures, restrictions on mass gatherings) and population self-regulation (e.g. isolation, mask wearing, social distancing).  Upon initiation of projections, all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 20% contact rate reduction. Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 20% contact rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario.

The parameters/inputs of this simulator are learned using hyperparameter optimization that minimizes the error between the projected outputs (projected daily deaths) and the actual results (reported daily deaths). Because the infections curve is unique for every region, we let the model use each region's own data to learn the best set of parameters for that region. This includes parameters such as: mortality rate, initial R_0, post-lockdown R, and the inflection date of any lockdowns. Other variables such as the latency period, infectious period, and virus shedding period are fixed based on published literature.

Each model compartment is sub-divided into nine different age categories.  To model the state of Illinois, we divide the state into four regions based on the Restore Illinois plan. We infer a common statewide pre-intervention transmission rate, and a separate post-intervention transmission rate for each of the four regions. We also infer a region-specific initial number of infected individuals. Other model parameters are informed by Illinois-specific data or best estimates from existing literature. We fit the model to incident in-hospital deaths and confirmed COVID-19 ICU cases prior to May 15, 2020.   For inference, we use maximum likelihood inference via sequential Monte Carlo for partially observed Markov process models (POMP).   We assume that hospitalized deaths are reported with probability 0.8075 and we fitted the reporting rate of non-hospitalized deaths.  The model can be adapted to investigate different types of interventions.  We currently model shelter-in-place as a reduction in the overall transmission rate, which is shared by all infected individuals, and reductions in age- and location-specific contact rates.\\nTo model the relaxing of shelter-in-place interventions, we project three different scenarios. 1) The inferred post-intervention transmission rate remains unchanged. We assume that this is maximum reduction in transmission and call this model CovidIL_100. 2) The post-SIP transmission rate increases 10% of the way back to pre-SIP transmission according to a logistic function centered on June 1. We call this model CovidIL_10_increase. 3) The post-SIP transmission rate increases 30% of the way back to pre-SIP transmission according to a logistic function centered on June 1.

Our model can consider the effect of many complexities of the epidemic process and yet be simplified to a few parameters that are learned using fast linear regressions. Therefore, our approach can learn and generate forecasts extremely quickly. On a 2 core desktop machine, our approach takes only 3.18s to tune hyper-parameters, learn parameters and generate 100 days of forecasts of reported cases and deaths for all the states in the US. The total execution time for 184 countries is 11.83s and for more than 3000 US counties is 101.03s. Despite being fast, the accuracy of our forecasts is on par with the state-of-the-art as demonstrated on the leaderboard page. at https://scc-usc.github.io/ReCOVER-COVID-19. Our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends, and the variations in parameters during different times/policies allow us to forecast different scenarios such as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions.'},\n",

Each model compartment is sub-divided into nine different age categories.  To model the state of Illinois, we divide the state into four regions based on the Restore Illinois plan. We infer a common statewide pre-intervention transmission rate, and a separate post-intervention transmission rate for each of the four regions. We also infer a region-specific initial number of infected individuals. Other model parameters are informed by Illinois-specific data or best estimates from existing literature. We fit the model to incident in-hospital deaths and confirmed COVID-19 ICU cases prior to May 15, 2020.   For inference, we use maximum likelihood inference via sequential Monte Carlo for partially observed Markov process models (POMP).   We assume that hospitalized deaths are reported with probability 0.8075 and we fitted the reporting rate of non-hospitalized deaths.  The model can be adapted to investigate different types of interventions.  We currently model shelter-in-place as a reduction in the overall transmission rate, which is shared by all infected individuals, and reductions in age- and location-specific contact rates.\\nTo model the relaxing of shelter-in-place interventions, we project three different scenarios. 1) The inferred post-intervention transmission rate remains unchanged. We assume that this is maximum reduction in transmission and call this model CovidIL_100. 2) The post-SIP transmission rate increases 10% of the way back to pre-SIP transmission according to a logistic function centered on June 1. 3) The post-SIP transmission rate increases 30% of the way back to pre-SIP transmission according to a logistic function centered on June 1.'},\n",

The starting point of the model is the hypothesis that although individuals and policy makers have responded to the epidemic with a wide variety of behavioral modifications and policy actions, the actual net impact of the measures taken, though not identical across time or geography, is predictable. Moreover, these predictions can be based upon what a society and its elected officials have demonstrated it (they) will accept as a reasonable aggregate impact from COVID19. This model seeks to identify one or more \"acceptability\" range(s) from observation of the epidemic up to the current time and to understand how much impact on infection rates is achieved by responses in this (these) range(s). Deaths, in turn, are related to infections via a simple (time- and geographically-varying) phenomenological model derived through fitting. This allows the model to build in spatiotemporal variation in the demographics of the population, its access to health care & COVID testing, and the actual infection fatality rate without explicitly considering these factors. At present the model is deterministic rather than probabilistic, and so only provides point forecasts. The model considers the United States at the state level.'},\n",

We produce a number of different intervention scenarios, each assuming various interventions and rates of compliance are implemented in the future.  This submission is the selection of the weekly scenario we believe to be most plausible given current observations and planned intervention policies.  The selected scenarios are listed below: June 14 - present '5_2xhold': This scenario assumes a weekly 5% increase in contact rates for two weeks.  The following week, the reproduction number R is set to 1 for the remainder of the projection.   June 7 '80contact1x5p' : This scenario assumes a weekly 20% decrease in counties with growing weekly cases and stay-at-home orders in place, and a one-time 5% increase in states that have reopened. May 7 - June 4 '80contactw5p': For states maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we apply a 20% weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that reopen, we apply a weekly 5% increase to the contact rate of counties in those states. May 3 '80contact1x10p': For states maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we apply a 20% weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that reopen, we apply a one-time 10% increase to the contact rate during the week that the state is scheduled to reopen and maintain this new increased rate for the remainder of the projection. April 12 - April 26 '70contact': This scenario mimics adaptive adjustments in contact imposed both by government regulations (e.g. school closures, restrictions on mass gatherings) and population self-regulation (e.g. isolation, mask wearing, social distancing).  Upon initiation of projections, all counties with 10 or more confirmed cases impose a 30% contact rate reduction. Each week following, if a county newly exceeds 10 confirmed cases, a 30% contact rate reduction is imposed, depending on the projection scenario. Counties that had previously exceeded 10 confirmed cases and also experience an increase in the number of weekly reported confirmed cases impose a further, multiplicative 30% contact rate reduction, depending on the projection scenario. \"},\n",
